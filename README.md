draughtsboard.js - JavaScript Draughts Board
==================================================

What is draughtsboard.js?
--------------------------------------

draughtsboard.js is a standalone JavaScript Draughts Board. It is designed to be "just a board" and expose a powerful API so that it can be used in different ways. Here's a non-exhaustive list of things you can do with draughtsboard.js:

- Use draughtsboard.js to show game positions alongside your expert commentary.
- Use draughtsboard.js to have a tactics website where users have to guess the best move.
- Integrate draughtsboard.js and [draughts.js](https://github.com/shubhendusaurabh/draughts.js) with a PDN database and allow people to search and playback games.
- Build a draughts server and have users play their games out using the draughtsboard.js board.

draughtsboard.js is flexible enough to handle any of these situations with relative ease.

What is draughtsboard.js not?
--------------------------------------

Here is a list of things that draughtsboard.js is **not**:

- A draughts engine
- A legal move validator
- A PGN parser

draughtsboard.js is designed to work well with any of those things, but the idea behind draughtsboard.js is that the logic that controls the board should be independent of those other problems.
